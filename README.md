# AI/ML Architect - Conversational and Agentic AI Portfolio

## ðŸŽ¯ Role Target: AI/ML Architect â€“ Conversational & Agentic AI (PepsiCo)

This repository demonstrates core capabilities aligned with the responsibilities and skills required for a senior-level Conversational & Agentic AI Architect, with a focus on practical, scalable, and secure implementations across Azure and AWS platforms.

## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

Iâ€™m a DevOps and Cloud Security Engineer transitioning into AI/ML Architect roles. I bring a strong background in secure infrastructure, CI/CD automation, and resilient cloud-native design. My learning style is hands-on and continuous â€” I build fast, test often, and document clearly.

### ðŸ’ª Strengths:
- Security-first mindset (OAuth2, identity, key vaults, RBAC)
- Fast learner with delivery-focused habits
- Solid base in infrastructure-as-code, Python, and distributed systems
- Real-world exposure to both Azure and AWS ecosystems
- Passionate about generative AI, conversational flows, and scalable LLM deployments

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. `embedding_pipeline.py`
> Ingest and process documents, generate embeddings using OpenAI or Hugging Face, and store them in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone or FAISS).

### 2. `rag_retrieval.py`
> Full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow combining vector search and LLM response generation. Powered by LangChain.

### 3. `chat_interface.py`
> Command-line chatbot interface with conversation memory, LLM backend (mock or OpenAI), and tool-ready design.

### 4. `api_gateway.py`
> Example REST API integration with LLM agent using FastAPI. Secured using OAuth2 token and `.env` key management.

### 5. `infra/`
> Infrastructure-as-Code files:
- `main.bicep`: resource group and identity creation
- `customRole.json`: custom role definition for agent deployment
